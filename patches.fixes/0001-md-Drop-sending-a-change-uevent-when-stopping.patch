Subject: [PATCH] md: Drop sending a change uevent when stopping
Git-commit: 399146b80ed6fb9f1ebe5a07234f00dff446d2b4
Patch-mainline: v4.6
References: bsc#1003568

When stopping an MD device, then its device node /dev/mdX may still
exist afterwards or it is recreated by udev. The next open() call
can lead to creation of an inoperable MD device. The reason for
this is that a change event (KOBJ_CHANGE) is sent to udev which
races against the remove event (KOBJ_REMOVE) from md_free().
So drop sending the change event.

A change is likely also required in mdadm as many versions send the
change event to udev as well.

Neil mentioned the change event is a workaround for old kernel
Commit: 934d9c23b4c7 ("md: destroy partitions and notify udev when md array is stopped.")
new mdadm can handle device remove now, so this isn't required any more.
