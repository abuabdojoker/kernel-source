Subject: nfs_prime_dcache needs fh to be set.
References: bnc#908069 bnc#896484
Patch-mainline: v4.0
Git-commit: 6c441c254eea2354d686be7f5544bcd79fb6a61f

(patch is mainline is very different to this one)

In some circumstances, READDIRPLUS does not return a filehandle.
A particular example is that the NFSv3 Linux server does not return a
filehandle for directories that are mounted on.

When that happens, we mustn't call nfs_prime_cache, as it can
mess up the mount table.

This is clearly a bug, and this is a safe file.  It is not certain if
it addresses either the referenced bugzilla issues.  It might.
