Subject: [PATCH] rtlwifi: rtl_usb: Fix missing entry in USB driver's private data
Git-commit: 60f59ce0278557f7896d5158ae6d12a4855a72cc
Patch-mainline: 4.10-rc4
References: bsc#1026462

These drivers need to be able to reference "struct ieee80211_hw" from
the driver's private data, and vice versa. The USB driver failed to
store the address of ieee80211_hw in the private data. Although this
bug has been present for a long time, it was not exposed until
commit ba9f93f82aba ("rtlwifi: Fix enter/exit power_save").
