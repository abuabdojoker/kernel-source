Subject: net: disable fragment reassembly if high_thresh is zero
Patch-mainline: v4.8-rc1
Git-commit: 30759219f562cfaaebe7b9c1d1c0e6b5445c69b0
References: bsc#970506

Before commit 6d7b857d541e ("net: use lib/percpu_counter API for
fragmentation mem accounting"), setting the reassembly high threshold
to 0 prevented fragment reassembly as first fragment would be always
evicted before second could be added to the queue. While inefficient,
some users apparently relied on this method.

Since the commit mentioned above, a percpu counter is used for
reassembly memory accounting and high batch size avoids taking slow path
in most common scenarios. As a result, a whole full sized packet can be
reassembled without the percpu counter's main counter changing its value
so that even with high_thresh set to 0, fragmented packets can be still
reassembled and processed.

Add explicit check preventing reassembly if high threshold is zero.
