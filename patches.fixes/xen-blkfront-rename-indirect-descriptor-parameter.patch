Subject: xen-blkfront: rename indirect descriptor parameter
From: jbeulich@suse.com
References: bsc#957986 fate#320625
Patch-Mainline: v4.6
Git-commit: 14e710fe7897e37762512d336ab081c57de579a4

"max" is rather ambiguous and carries pretty little meaning, the more
that there are also "max_queues" and "max_ring_page_order". Make this
"max_indirect_segments" instead, and at once change the type from int
to uint (to match the respective variable's type).
