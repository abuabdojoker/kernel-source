Subject: [PATCH] ftrace/x86: Set ftrace_stub to weak to prevent gcc from using
 short jumps to it
Patch-mainline: v4.7-rc1
Git-commit: 8329e818f14926a6040df86b2668568bde342ebf
References: bsc#984419

Matt Fleming reported seeing crashes when enabling and disabling
function profiling which uses function graph tracer. Later Namhyung Kim
hit a similar issue and he found that the issue was due to the jmp to
ftrace_stub in ftrace_graph_call was only two bytes, and when it was
changed to jump to the tracing code, it overwrote the ftrace_stub that
was after it.

Masami Hiramatsu bisected this down to a binutils change:

    Add -mshared option to x86 ELF assembler

    This patch adds -mshared option to x86 ELF assembler.  By default,
    assembler will optimize out non-PLT relocations against defined non-weak
    global branch targets with default visibility.  The -mshared option tells
    the assembler to generate code which may go into a shared library
    where all non-weak global branch targets with default visibility can
    be preempted.  The resulting code is slightly bigger.  This option
    only affects the handling of branch instructions.

Declaring ftrace_stub as a weak call prevents gas from using two byte
jumps to it, which would be converted to a jump to the function graph
code.
