Subject: [PATCH] cgroup: add seq_file forward declaration for struct cftype
Git-commit: c80ef9e0c021ff86771fdd72583c75d8f7b6a720
Patch-mainline: 4.2-rc1
References: bsc#1005101

Recent header file changes for cgroup caused lots of warnings
about a missing struct seq_file form declaration for every
inclusion of include/linux/cgroup-defs.h.

As some files are built with -Werror, this leads to build
failure like:

                 from /git/arm-soc/drivers/gpu/drm/tilcdc/tilcdc_crtc.c:18:
/git/arm-soc/include/linux/cgroup-defs.h:354:25: error: 'struct seq_file' declared inside parameter list [-Werror]
Cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
Make[6]: *** [drivers/gpu/drm/tilcdc/tilcdc_crtc.o] Error 1

This patch adds the declaration, which resolves both the
warnings and the drm failure.

Tj: Moved it where other type declarations are.
