Subject: gro: Defer clearing of flush bit in tunnel paths
Patch-mainline: v4.6-rc1
Git-commit: c194cf93c164ed1c71142485ee0f70f9f2d1fe35
References: CVE-2016-7039 bsc#1001486

This patch updates the GRO handlers for GRE, VXLAN, GENEVE, and FOU so that
we do not clear the flush bit until after we have called the next level GRO
handler.  Previously this was being cleared before parsing through the list
of frames, however this resulted in several paths where either the bit
needed to be reset but wasn't as in the case of FOU, or cases where it was
being set as in GENEVE.  By just deferring the clearing of the bit until
after the next level protocol has been parsed we can avoid any unnecessary
bit twiddling and avoid bugs.

openSUSE-42.1: omit geneve part (geneve driver was added in v4.2-rc1)
