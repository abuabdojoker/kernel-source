 cxlflash: Move to exponential back-off when cmd_room is not available

While profiling the cxlflash_queuecommand() path under a heavy load it
was found that number of retries to find cmd_room was fairly high.

There are two problems with the current back-off:
a) It starts with a udelay of 0
b) It backs-off linearly

Tried several approaches (a higher multiple 10*n, 100*n, as well as n^2,
2^n) and found that the exponential back-off(2^n) approach had the least
overall cost. Cost as being defined as overall time spent waiting.

The fix is to change the linear back-off to an exponential back-off.
This solution also takes care of the problem with the initial
delay (starts with 1 usec).
