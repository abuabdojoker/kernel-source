Subject: [PATCH 14/14] Input: synaptics - remove X250 from the topbuttonpad
 list

Lenovo X250 has a PnpID of LEN0046, but it does not have the top software
button requirement.

For the record, Lenovo T450s and W541 have a PnpID of LEN200f and LEN004a,
so they are not on the top software button list.
