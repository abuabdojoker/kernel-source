Subject: [PATCH] qed: Fix removal of spoof checking for VFs
Patch-mainline: v4.8-rc1
Git-commit: cb1fa088772e9e331841b10bea88d833ec8c01fa
References: bsc#966318 FATE#320158 bsc#966316 FATE#320159

Driver has reverse logic for checking the result of the
spoof-checking configuration. As a result, it would log that
the configuration failed [even though it succeeded], and will
no longer do anything when requested to remove the configuration,
as it's accounting of the feature will be incorrect.

Fixes: 6ddc7608258d5 ("qed*: IOV support spoof-checking")
