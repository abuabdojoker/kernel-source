Subject: [PATCH 077/101] clk: bcm2835: Fix PLL poweron
Git-commit: e708b383f4b94feca2e0d5d06e1cfc13cdfea100
Patch-mainline: v4.7-rc1
References: FATE#319481

In poweroff, we set the reset bit and the power down bit, but only
managed to unset the reset bit for poweron.  This meant that if HDMI
did -EPROBE_DEFER after it had grabbed its clocks, we'd power down the
PLLH (that had been on at boot time) and never recover.
