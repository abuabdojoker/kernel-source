Subject: pagecache_limit: batch large nr_to_scan targets
Patch-mainline: never
References: bnc#895221

Although pagecache_limit is expected to be set before the load is started there
seem to be a user which sets the limit after the machine is short on memory and
has a large amount of the page cache already. Although such a usage is dubious
at best we still shouldn't fall flat under such conditions.

We had a report where a machine with 512GB of RAM crashed as a result of hard
lockup detector (which is on by default) when the limit was set to 1G because
the page cache reclaimer got a target of 22M pages and isolate_lru_pages simply
starved other spinners for too long.

This patch batches the scan target by SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX chunks to prevent
from such issues. It should be still noted that setting limit to a
very small value wrt. an already large page cache target is dangerous and can
lead to big reclaim storms and page cache over-reclaim.
