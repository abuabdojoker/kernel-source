Subject: [PATCH] kgr: reserve a place in thread_struct for storing RIP on
 x86_64
Patch-mainline: Never, SUSE-Xen specific
References: fate#313296

In order to be able to patch __schedule() function with kGraft we need
to store proper RIP in switch_to macro and use it as a return address.
This ensures that a task will follow consistent path (with respect to
old/new universes) all the way in __schedule(). Otherwise it could be
possible that a task is woken up with the different code than it went
to sleep with. The RIP should be stored in thread_struct embedded to
task_struct. Reserve a place for that even for x86_64 arch.
